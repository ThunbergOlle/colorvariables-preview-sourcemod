# Colorvariables previewer
A light-weight program for previewing strings for plugins like "ColorVariables" in sourcemod. :sunglasses:

[Downloads](https://github.com/ThunbergOlle/colorvariables-preview-sourcemod/blob/master/downloads.md)  :heart:

Simply input the string and it will show you the preview of the result.:thumbsup:

That seems nice huh?
It's free to use and easy to run. Also :bug: can be reported [here](https://github.com/ThunbergOlle/colorvariables-preview-sourcemod/issues)

If you feel like the current version isn't enough and wants the latest features? Consider doing this in order to compile the latest updates:

Node is required for this. :leaves:
```
1. Open a CMD
2. Navigate to the project's directory
3. Run the command "npm run-scripts build"
4. Wait until it's finished
5. There should be a new directory created. Just drag that onto your desktop.
```
